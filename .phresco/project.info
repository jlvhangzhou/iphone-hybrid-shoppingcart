This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful and dynamic web pages and web applications.\n\njQuery contains the following features:\n1)DOM element selections using the cross-browser open source selector engine Sizzle, a spin-off out of the jQuery project.\n2)DOM traversal and modification (including support for CSS 1-3)\n3)Events\n4)CSS manipulation\n5)Effects and animations\n6)Ajax\n7)Extensibility through plug-ins\n8)Utilities - such as user agent information, feature detection\n9)Compatibility methods that are natively available in modern browsers but need fallbacks for older ones - For example the inArray() and each()         functions.\n10)Cross-browser support\n","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"documentsid":0,"version":"1.6.2","url":"/jslibraries/files/jslib_jquery/1.6.2/jslib_jquery-1.6.2.zip","modulesid":0}]},{"id":"jslib_plist_parser","name":"Plist_parser","core":false,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"A simple parser to parse the XML plist file and converts them to JSON objects\n\n","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"PlistParser accepts a Property List expressed as an XML string and transforms it into a JavaScript data structure.
